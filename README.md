## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a cloud-deployed data platform that:  

- Ingests weather and related datasets (historical and real-time).  
- Processes and cleans data efficiently.  
- Applies statistical and ML models to generate predictions.  
- Exposes insights via APIs and dashboards for end-users.  

**Core Principle:** Every milestone integrates mathematical concepts learned, demonstrating practical mastery of data engineering, analytics, and cloud deployment.

## Features

### M1 ‚Äì ETL Skeleton (Foundation)
- Fetch weather data from APIs using the `LoadFromApi` Python class.  
- Store raw JSON data in PostgreSQL.  
- Normalize timestamps, temperature, humidity, and other key fields.  
- Tools: Python, `requests`, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, OpenMeteoAPI.

<!-- ### M2 ‚Äì Data Cleaning + Scheduling
- Clean datasets: remove nulls, standardize units.  
- Schedule daily ETL runs using Apache Airflow (local execution).

### M3 ‚Äì Initial EDA & Storage Design
- Use pandas for exploratory data analysis.  
- Store summary statistics in PostgreSQL tables.  
- Provide reproducible Jupyter notebooks for exploration.

### Later Phases
- Regression and classification models (temperature prediction, extreme weather detection).  
- Model monitoring with alerts.  
- Distributed processing with Spark/Dask.  
- Streaming data ingestion and integration.  
- Cloud deployment with Docker, AWS ECS/EKS, CI/CD pipelines.  
- FastAPI endpoints and Streamlit dashboards for interactive insights. -->
